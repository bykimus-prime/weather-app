# weather-app

A standard weather app. This project focuses on using APIs, specifically for weather, to extract data and display it to the webpage. This involves processing JSON data from the API source, returning that object with only the data I need, and setting up a simple form allowing user to input their location or search cities for their weather. The user can also change from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and back.

## Built With 

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

In order to setup and work on this project on your own, you will need to:

1. Clone this project:  
`git clone https://github.com/bykimus-prime/weather-app.git`

### Usage
##### The app will auto-default the city to Seattle and display its weather.
- **Search Field** - User can type any city of their choice. Though if there are multiple cities in the world I did not implement the ability to differentiate between countries, etc.
- **C to F Toggle** - Default is Celsius, and the toggle will change to the other when clicked.
